automation:
  - alias: "Bedtime Ambient Sounds"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "22:00:00"
    action:
      - service: ambient_sounds.play_favorite
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.bedroom_speaker
          favorite_id: "12345"  # Your favorite rain sound ID

    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "09:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.workday
        state: "on"
    action:
      - service: ambient_sounds.play_favorite
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.office_speaker
          favorite_id: "67890"  # Your favorite forest sound ID

## How It Works

1. **Search**: The integration uses Freesound's API to search their audio library
2. **Stream**: Audio files are streamed directly from Freesound's servers
3. **Favorites**: Your saved favorites are stored locally in Home Assistant using the Store helper
4. **Playback**: Sounds play on any compatible media player in your network

## Configuration Options

After initial setup, you can modify settings through **Options**:

- **Results per search**: Number of results to show per search (1-150, default: 20)

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid API key" error during setup:**
- Double-check your API key from https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/
- Ensure you copied the entire key without extra spaces

**No search results:**
- Check your API quota (5,000 requests/month on free tier)
- Try different search terms
- Verify your internet connection

**Sounds won't play:**
- Ensure your media player supports HTTP audio streaming
- Check that the media player is powered on and connected
- Verify the audio URL is still valid (Freesound URLs are permanent)

## API Limits

Freesound's free tier provides:
- 5,000 API requests per month
- Each search counts as one request
